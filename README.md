## Slides

I don't upload my slides due to some problems I've had with copyright infringement.

You can find all the slides within the talk in the [index file]() within this build. It's just an HTML file so pretty easy to navigate - all my slide notes are there, as well within the markup.

## Get in touch

I tend to talk about Audio, MIDI and/or real time visuals, all related to web technologies. I either do this stand-a-lone or as part of the [{ Live : JS } collective](lives.network), where we also provide workshops, installations and shows.
