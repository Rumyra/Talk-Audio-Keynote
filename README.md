## About

Keynote for Web Audio Conf 2018.

I miss physical audio formats, so I spoke about them. My own experience of formats throughout my life and a couple of experiments that came form my thoughts. I think this is really the start of a bigger project. But it's a nice opener for Web Audio Conf to relax everyone and give them something to think about.

## Slides

I don't upload my slides due to some problems I've had with copyright infringement.

You can find all the slides within the talk in the [index file](https://github.com/Rumyra/Talk-Audio-Keynote/blob/master/views/index.html) within this build. It's just an HTML file so pretty easy to navigate - all my slide notes are there, as well, within the markup.
