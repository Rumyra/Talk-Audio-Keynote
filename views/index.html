            <p>It was improved by ALexander Graham Bell's Volta Labratory and wax cylinders became the distributed audio format.</p>

          <blockquote>
            <q>Nearly 150 years after they had been recorded, promising specimens of Scott de Martinville's phonautograms, ... were located by American audio historians. ... In 2008, the team played back the recordings as sound for the first time. Modern computer-based image processing methods were used to accomplish the playback. ... generally available image-editing and image-to-sound conversion software, requiring only a high-quality scan of the phonautogram and an ordinary personal computer, were found to be sufficient for this application.</q>

          <aside class="notes">
            <p>Phonautograph of course being the recording of sound, as a line on smoke blackened paper or glass</p>
            <p>Now you couldn't play it back - which was the opposite of the paper format - the piano roll or music box. Where you could play back but you weren't strictly recording the audio.</p>
            <p>But this quote I really luv:</p>
            <p>interesting</p>
            <p>In the 1890's Emile Berliner transited from cylinders to flat discs and the gramophone was born.</p>

            <p>You could do a whole talk about this format, the size 12", 10", 7", the speed 33 1/3 rpm, 45 rpm, if you keep a vinyl in the right conditions it'll last for ever.</p>
            <p>This I do remember</p>
            <p>One thing that's made me think of it more is how much I miss physical formats. Now I'm sure there's a great deal of people in this room still big into their physical formats for audio.</p>
            <p>However I gave this up a while ago. And it was only recently did I start thinking about it again.</p>
            <p>This was my first experience of music. Routing through these old battered cardboard boxes. Repeat playing one track I liked. Kids are insatiable huh, repeating things over and over and never getting bored - I mean they can actualy complete donkey kong</p>
            <p>I was talking to my mum about this - she said what did you play on repeat, and I just answered D I S C O</p>
            <p>She said - we didn't own that - we were cool</p>

            <p>The other thing is curation - people recommend me artists now, rather than give me a few songs which are the best of from different artists</p>
            <p>I have spoke about this with a number of friends recently and one of them looked so sad and just said. Yes it used to be my favourite thing to give to a girl I fancied. I would just make them a mix CD. I mean I was like CD? Give me a tape bucko. But I got his point.</p>

It's super the most fun ever. I have a lot of toys and this is surely my favourite at the moment. (Wait until I get a MIDI fighter and ask me again).</p>

            <p>So I began experimenting. I wasn't too sure what I was trying to start with. There's a couple of stems I can go down. The first is cutting something that plays.</p>
            <p>The laser cutter can engrave. You can engrave at different levels, so you get different 'tones' on a material. Light or dark. They could represent different notes. Possibly different tracks.</p>
