            <p>One thing that's made me think of it more is how much I miss physical formats. Now I'm sure there's a great deal of people in this room still big into their physical formats for audio.

            <p>I'm of the age where how I consume audio has change dramatically. My first experience of listening to music was my parents LPs. Routing through this huge battered cardboard boxes. Repeat playing The Beatles, ABBA, DISCO. There's something insatiable about being a child isn't there, where you can just repeat something over, and over, and over. Play a record, watch a movie, actually complete Donkey Kong.</p>
            <p>I was talking to my mum about this and she said, what was your favourite LP - and I said DISCO and she said - we didn't have that, we were cool</p>
            <p>Apparently definitions of cool change with time as well</p>

          <aside class="notes">
            <p>I remember begging my mother my own stereo when I was about 11. I had discovered tape casettes. If I'm honest, this is my ultimate format. There are reasons why all formats are good, but this one is my format.</p>

          <h1>Why cassettes</h1>
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>But those cases, when you opened them and took out the cassette and slid it into the carridge and closed it. All of that mechanical motion is so satisfying. Buttons - pressing buttons is great. Play, pause - up and down. Stop, eject when it clicks back out again. Getting old cassettes and putting tape over the corners so you could record whatever songs you wanted off the radio. I was 12 and I was curating mix tapes.</p>

          <aside class="notes">
            <p>Then CDs and minidisks came along. Now I'm sure if I'd had the funds I would have got into mini disks - they were more compact. Luckily I could only afford one, and that was for when I studied Music Technology at college and the track I composed and recorded in a studio was mixed down to it. I still have it and am I glad I have nothing to play it on! No one needs to hear that.</p>

            <p>Everyone was excited by laser disks</p>
            <p>I never took to CDs. I experienced them for the most part as computer data and well, they scratch and broke and got corrupted. They took up room. I was still playing tapes.</p>
            <p>By this time I could drive and I mean I never had a car with anything apart from a tape player. Cars with CD players were - well posh, and it wasn't long before mp3 players came out and as we well know, if you wanted to play mp3s in your car - you could do that just as well with a tape player.</p>

          <aside class="notes">
            <p>And then there was a huge gap, I felt I lost my way. I had my mp3 collection and that was that. All that happened when streaming came around was I collated all the mp3s in my already collection that was sitting around random dusty hard drives.</p>

          <h1>Sharing</h1>
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>The thing about a physical format is you can give it to someone. Streaming open up a whole new world for us and yet no one gave me music.</p>
            <p>I have spoke about this with a number of friends recently and one of them looked so sad and just said. Yes it used to be my favourite thing to give to a girl I fancied. I would just make them a mix CD. I mean I was like CD? Give me a tape bucko. But I got his point.</p>

            <p>And people have tried this. There have been a few apps trying to emulate the old mix tape by curating a streamable playlist which you can share with a significant other. However they've never caught on. We're just too ok with everything on demand.</p>

            <p>This phone tho. It's an interesting thing that allows us to play music. And not just to stream. It's been a creative concept for quite sometime but harking back to these past 12 months some other interesting things happened. Three people I know who also build things with code all in very quick succession made javascript based apps that played things. This isn't a new concept and is proving to be very common, especially in the realm of generative art which is increasing in popularity.</p>

            <p>It's awesome. It's a 'desktop' laser cutter. It fills my studio. You hook it up to your wifi, draw an svg in the software and it will cut it, or engrave it. It's super the most fun ever. I have a lot of toys and this is surely my favourite at the moment. (Wait until I get a MIDI fighter and ask me again).</p>

            <p>So I began experimenting. I wasn't too sure what I was trying to start with. There's a couple of stems I can go down. The first is cutting something that plays. The laser cutter can engrave. You can engrave at different levels, so you get different 'tones' on a material. Light or dark. They could represent different notes. Possibly different tracks.</p>
